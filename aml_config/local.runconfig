# The program name and arguments to run when they aren't specified through
# other means. The $file token is replaced with the currently selected file

ArgumentVector:
  - "$file"

# The name of the compute target to use for this run.
Target: "local"

# Environment variables set for the run.
EnvironmentVariables:
  "EXAMPLE_ENV_VAR": "Example Value"

# Framework to execute inside. Allowed values are "Python" and "PySpark".
Framework: "Python"

# Path to the Conda dependencies file to use for this run. If a project
# contains multiple programs with different sets of dependencies, it may be
# convenient to manage those environments with separate files.
CondaDependenciesFile: "aml_config/conda_dependencies.yml"

# Path to the Spark dependencies file to use for this run. If a project
# contains multiple programs with different sets of dependencies, it may be
# convenient to manage those environments with separate files.

# Automatically prepare the run environment as part of the run itself.
# Manual preparation of a compute target can be perfomed with:
# az ml experiment prepare --run-configuration <run configuration name>
PrepareEnvironment: false

# Enable history tracking -- this allows status, logs, metrics, and outputs
# to be collected by Azure ML Workbench and uploaded to the cloud project.
TrackedRun: true

# The UseSampling setting controls the use of sample data or complete data on 
# all .dsource and .dprep files. Setting this to false will read all the data 
# when loading data using either a .dsource or .dprep file.
UseSampling: true

# For each data source (.dsource or .dprep file), the Sample setting allows a 
# specific named sample to be used, overriding the active sample set in the 
# .dsource or .dprep file.
# DataSourceSettings:
#   my.dsource:
#     Sampling:
#       Sample: MySampleName

# Data source substitutions allows all references to a .dsource, be it in a 
# .dprep file or in your code to load data, to instead use a different .dsource. 
# It can be useful to setup two .dsources and then substitute the second one 
# when running in some compute targets.
# DataSourceSubstitutions:
#     my.dsource: replacement.dsource
